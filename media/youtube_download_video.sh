usage_description="
Downloads a YouTube, Facebook or Twitter / X video to mp4 with maximum quality and compatibility using yt-dlp

Opens the video automatically for you to check the download

Even resumes downloads after network interruptions or a Control-C and re-run the command later

Installs yt-dlp (for downloading) and ffmpeg (for conversions) via OS package manager if not already installed

If you run into a error determining a video format to download such as this:

    WARNING: [youtube] RVVDi1PHgw4: nsig extraction failed: Some formats may be missing

If you run into this error:

    ERROR: [youtube] ...: Sign in to confirm youâ€™re not a bot.

Then set this in your shell first with the name of your browser:

    export COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER=chrome

Try to upgrade yt-dlp first as sites like YouTube update their site breaking this and requiring a yt-dlp update
